# VR-AR
[ModelHouse_Contents] \
This was practiced with the Unity.\
There is an animation function that automatically opens and closes the door.\
If the main camera is looking at the door, the flag value is changed to false and the door opening animation is activated.\
It was basically arranged using furniture from the asset store, and the brightness of the model house was adjusted.\
